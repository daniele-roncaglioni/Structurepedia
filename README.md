# Structurepedia

Structurepedia is a hybrid between a search engine and an online encyclopaedia which generates, for any topic you want,
an interactive, resource-rich and AI powered diagram/mind-map.

Just [try it out](https://structurepedia.org/)!

## Problem

Two issues plague self-guided online exploration

#### Lack of structure and context

Books, blog posts, videos etc. aim to convey knowledge as a largely unstructured stream of information.
The presence of structured representations such as diagrams, timelines etc. is treated as optional and secondary. The
user has to parse the information into a structured hierarchy of relationships to build the information into fungible
knowledge.

#### Random walk

Search or recommender engines suggest resources that are identical or only very closely related to the thing you
currently searched/are looking at. Charting your own path through a new topic you are trying to learn becomes a random
walk in a dark forest, in which you lack an overview or guiding principle.

## Goal

Offer a new way to approach, navigate and learn complex topics, effectively blending a search engine and an online
encyclopedia into a structured, AI powered learning environment that aims to transmit knowledge more effectively than
traditional media and platforms.

## Solution

A search engine that returns results as a structured and AI powered interactive diagram integrated with traditional
resources.

#### Flow

You search for a topic -> Structurepedia returns a visual diagram -> quickly get an overview over a topic.
